-SPECIFIC SITUATION (Design Type)
	
	- I wrote the project according to first type ("Design a" in the warning mail, where I check the 
		first arriving processes in the context switch time.)
	- So I tested my project according to supplementary file 1.
	- "make clean" and "make run" commands delete the previously generated output files by the program. 
		See makefile for details.(You can delete the responsible lines.)
-USAGE

	-In order to compile the program simply run make command.
	-In order to run the program with the default definition.txt file run command: 'make run'.

	-If you want to run a specific definition file, simply run the program with the argument:
		- ./program.out my_definition_file.txt

	-Run 'make clean' to remove the object files, executable and output files that are generated by the program.
	
-NOTES
	
	-Program prints the execution results onto file my_output.txt
		-If you run the program consecutively it apppends the content to the file.
		-In order to automatize this I added rm -f output* command into make run before running the process.
			that way files are removed and recreated for each execution of the program.
			If you don't want to use this configuration, you can simply delete the line "rm -f output* " in make run tab in makefile.
			(You might want it to append results onto the same file for different inputs, for testing.) 
	-C++ 11 is used.
	-All of the data structures are from standard library.
	-All input files must be in the same directory with the source files to run properly.
